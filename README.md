# Movies-ETL
using an ETL process to organize a clean dataset for the Amazing Prime Video Hackathon

## Summary
In this challenge, I wrote an Extract, Transform, Load (or ETL) function to read the data files from Wikipedia, Kaggle, and MovieLens websites. Next, I extracted and transformed the Wikipedia data and the Kaggle data. With the function to read the data and the transformed data, I used PostgreSQL to create a database with two tables: movies and ratings.
